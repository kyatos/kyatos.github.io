                    <p>First performance of <strong><em>Superintelligent Sentimental</em></strong>, a science fiction world formed by interweaving speculative writing and music. Influenced by Buddhist and Daoist symbols and sensibilities, this performance is a prologue of images, affects, and characters from a world organized and governed by interconnected superintelligences. Through circular electronic music, poetry performance, and vocalizations, we seek a meeting point between our visions of the past and future, in order to re-imagine what is possible here and now. In tandem with the release of a music EP and book of fictive verse, prose, and dialogue.</p>

                    <p>The untitled suite of poems offers <span class="theme">oracular visions of urban romance and collapse</span>, weaving a middle way between dystopia and utopia. They wonder about <span class="theme">the diminishment of human reproductivity in favour of productivity</span>, as well as the conferring of re/productive power to the city's concrete body, which seems to replicate itself with no end.</p>
                    <p>The performance <strong><em>Nothing changes how I feel</em></strong> takes its title from a line of the poem. Imbuing the emotional invitation of the space with relational force, it situated us within an oracle's visit to a city's ruins where she meets an old lover whose body has become one with the ancient concrete.</p>

                        an astrology-akashic records inquiry with Salty Xi Jie Ng into the symbiosis between artistic and divinatory practices, as well as sustainability, fatigue, and strategy in the arts ecosystem

                    <p>The Artists' Institute for Quantum Kinship, run by astrologer Ang Kia Yee and <a href="http://bit.ly/akashicartist" target="_blank">akashic records practitioner Salty Xi Jie Ng</a>, both artists, investigates the symbiosis between artistic and divinatory practices.</p>
                    <p>In our epistemological age which favours logic, rationality, and what is visible, measurable, and quantifiable, these practices have been relegated to the categories of the esoteric, irrational, and illusory. They nonetheless persist in dedicated communities comprising practitioners who are committed to the luminosity and potency of these practices of knowledge. More recently, research into quantum physics has revealed that the apparent solid and fixed nature of what we see and think we know is far from the truth of reality, which extends past the visible, measurable, and quantifiable. </p>
                    <p>Similarly, art-making and devising an artistic practice over a lifetime is not unlike a continuous act of divination, conjuring, prophecy, and communion with the otherworldly. Seeing these resonances, we decided to establish The Artists’ Institute for Quantum Kinship to investigate, deepen, and extend these intersections to and with fellow artists.</p>
