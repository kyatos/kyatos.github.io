            <p><strong>Dream Interpretation</strong><br><br>

              If one is born a boy — become a moth.<br>
              If one is born a girl — become a moth.<br>
              If one is born a son — become smoke.<br>
              If one is born a daughter — become fire.<br>
              If one is born a moth — become a girl.<br>
              If one is born a means — become a god.<br>
              If one is born a memory — become paper.<br>
              If one is born a motive — become a moth.<br>
              If one is born a gun — become a girl.<br>
              If one is born a mother — become a girl.<br>
              If one is born accused — become a god.<br>
              If one is born afraid — become a mother.<br><br>

              If one dreams<br>
              Of their mother, it means memory<br>
              Is over. It is now<br>
              Impossible to say if I was born.<br>
              The two witnesses don't talk. They don't remember<br>
              One of them<br>
              Lying there, pushing<br>
              The other one out. There is no blood<br>
              Between them. No one can say<br>
              I was born. I appeared.<br>
              Now that I haven't been born<br>
              I cannot dream of my mother.<br><br>

              If one dreams<br>
              Of their daughter, it means the gods<br>
              Have come to collect their dues. It is now<br>
              A field we're standing in<br>
              Looking at each other for the first time.<br>
              We don't recognise<br>
              Each other. We know in an instant<br>
              Who we are.<br>
              I know I am a girl.<br>
              You know you are a god.<br>
              You have come to collect me, and I am<br>
              Ready to be returned.<br>
              <br>
