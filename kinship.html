            <h1 class="mb-4"><br>>> art-themed natal chart readings, January 2026</h1>
            <p>Astrological natal readings interpret your life story through mathematical and lyrical processes which honour your agency to chart a path of your choosing, in collaboration with your natural patterns and tendencies. </p>
            <p>Following my current research interests, I am offering art-themed natal chart readings at a discount in parallel with <strong>The Artists' Institute for Quantum Kinship</strong>'s residency at dblspace. They are not an official part of the residency, but form a vital complement to the lines of inquiry taking place there.</p>
            <p>These readings focus on art and art-making within your natal chart, spanning areas such as
                <ul>
                    <li>your artistic inclinations and potential directions</li>
                    <li>the general flow of your creative energy</li>
                    <li>challenges in art-making</li>
                    <li>ways to replenish your creative energy</li>
                    <li>profiles of helpful collaborators</li>
                    <li>general career potential and challenges</li>

                <p>The Artists' Institute for Quantum Kinship, run by astrologer Ang Kia Yee and akashic records practitioner Salty Xi Jie Ng, both artists, investigates the symbiosis between artistic and divinatory practices.</p>
                <p>Astrology maps and articulates the story of an individual through a process both mathematical and lyrical; akashic channelling taps intimately into the quantum field of consciousness for messages from otherworldly allies. These relational practices help us understand how we are inherently constellational, within and without, across space-time.</p>
                <p>In our epistemological age which favours logic, rationality, and what is visible, measurable, and quantifiable, these practices have been relegated to the categories of the esoteric, irrational, and illusory. They nonetheless persist in dedicated communities comprising practitioners who are committed to the luminosity and potency of these practices of knowledge. More recently, research into quantum physics has revealed that the apparent solid and fixed nature of what we see and think we know is far from the truth of reality, which extends past the visible, measurable, and quantifiable. </p>
                <p>Similarly, art-making and devising an artistic practice over a lifetime is not unlike a continuous act of divination, conjuring, prophecy, and communion with the otherworldly. Seeing these resonances, we decided to establish The Artists’ Institute for Quantum Kinship to investigate, deepen, and extend these intersections to and with fellow artists.</p>

                <p><strong>Residency at dblspace</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8 description">
                <p>This first season of activation at the Institute takes place as a residency at dblspace (Singapore) for the month of January 2026.</p>
                <p>We will activate the space with a myriad of activities, such as a workshop for artists to learn to read their astrological charts and a group akashic meditation (both art practice themed), as well as private astrological and akashic readings for those who choose to delve deeper. Additionally, we wish to explore affirmations as an emotional and spiritual tool for artists - leading a workshop and hosting a final gathering where we will share our original affirmational soundtrack for Singaporean artists, crafted from our research into our peers’ anxieties and aspirations. The final gathering will also include a discussion on the tension between the rational and divinatory. The space will evolve with annotated birth charts, drawings and notes from our readings, events, and encounters.</p>
                <p>We are interested in dblspace as a centrally-sited space to research the intersections of art and quantum kinship, building expanded community in the process. We wish to cultivate intimacies between artists, between artists and the cosmos, between art and the cosmos.  dblspace, as an accessible space which is visible to and well-known by the arts community, would be an ideal place for the first iteration of the Institute to emerge—to be a space where artists gather; deepen their relationships with art and the cosmos through these divinatory lenses; and develop new intimacies with themselves, each other, and the world.</p>
