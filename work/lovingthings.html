                    <strong><em>Loving Things</em></strong> was a series of videos about how to love
                    inanimate things. Through meditative attention and playful gestures which displace the usual function of
                    objects, as well as voiced texts that alight on quantum physics and new materialism, the videos invite
                    the viewer to look more deeply into objects as 'vibrant matter' (Jane Bennett). <br><br>
                    <em>Loving Things</em> was made available for purchase as a downloadable album of videos, both as a
                    response to Covid-19 restrictions, as well as a way of experimenting with the presentation,
                    distribution, ownership and consumption of performance.<br><br>

                    I revisited <em>Loving Things</em> in 2021 as <strong><em><a

                    by the Esplanade.<br><br>
                    It was a short, gentle extension of motifs within <em>Loving
                        Things</em>, with greater attention to sonic possibilities around voice, and a more direct addressal
                    of ecological anxiety and species extinction.<br><br>

                        "I watched it all come to an end. It didn't happen as an explosion or the ground splitting open.
                        There
                        was time for people to gather and part, for night to fall and morning to come again, for the Earth
                        to
                        continue its revolutions undisturbed. There was time, even, to stand still in a park and feel the
                        breeze
                        touch our faces.<br><br>
                        In that time, open and vast, we restored the ozone layer.<br>
                        We fished out plastic from the oceans.<br>
                        We learnt how important it is to sleep.<br>
                        We took evening walks together, after work, talking and laughing about nothing important.<br>
                        We convinced the billionaires to change their minds.<br>
                        We made farming a school subject for primary school students.<br>
                        We went to the beach and looked out at the water.<br>
                        We waited quietly for the kettle to boil.<br><br>
                        We used solar panels to power our homes.<br>
                        We went out less between 11am and 2pm, when the sun was at its highest point in the sky.<br>
                        We read our favourite stories aloud to one another.<br>
                        We discovered the people we had been all along.<br>
                        We made insects a food staple.<br>
                        We divested from fossil fuels.<br>
                        We made good on our promises to one another.<br><br>
                        Still, it all came to an end, as all things do. In our final moments, we put our laundry in the
                        washing
                        machine. We stirred milk into our cups of tea. We scrolled through the news and received message
                        notifications. We watered our plants. The sky was still blue, the clouds still threatening to rain.
                        The
                        bus was still late. A flower was still making the enormous effort to bloom."
