                    <em>City of New Ruins</em> was a multidisciplinary project about Forest City, an uncanny mirror of Singapore situated in Johor Bahru.<br><br>
                    The suite of poems offered oracular visions of urban romance and collapse, weaving a middle way between dystopia and utopia. They wondered about the diminishment of human reproductivity in favour of productivity, as well as the conferring of re/productive power to the city's concrete body, which seems to replicate itself with no end.<br><br>
                    The performance brought life force into the emotional invitation of the space, situating us within an oracle's journey to a city's ruins, where she meets an old lover whose body has become one with the ancient concrete.<br><br>

First omen: Fish swim onto land,
Gasping with song, they strike
Their bodies against
The encroaching concrete, whole
Constellations of windows
Sliding towards the sea.

The ancient condo, its sacred
Foundation, drains, backfill, walls, fenestration, insulation, cladding, scaffolding, gyplap, window membranes, urethane, composite finish, prefab furnishings
Paint peeling off the face of this absent deity
A ruined dream
Where we were promised rest,
Where hard work ended
And some other life — the money, the baby, the expensive hobby, the vintage furniture, the promotion, the Chanel and Porsche, ceiling-to-floor Roman blinds, marble kitchen island, home cinema, the renewal of vows, vinyl and glass horizon to horizon — began.

Second omen: Nothing changes how I feel,
Nausea on the balcony, throbbing 
Pain in the lobby, I’m afraid I am stalked
By a mermaid singing 
From the drains. Despite regular cleaning, 
Our interiors are overrun by
The fervid, fecund, fungal, damp, a green
So dark it evokes blood. 

Third omen: I had a dream so different
From the ones before that I
Snapped awake. In that dream
I woke up, found fins, gills, a tail behind me.
I glided soundlessly in no particular direction
Beneath an endless ceiling of light.

—--

The concrete seems to melt under our touch
As, tightly coupled, we 
Move from place to place
Fused, chimeric. You serve me; 
I deserve you. I am the base material
From which you are sluiced out of:
Foundation, drains, backfill, walls, fenestration, insulation, cladding, scaffolding, gyplap, window membranes, urethane, composite finish, prefab furnishings
Arriving in one piece to eat the sky, iterating
Closer and closer to a single, unending image
Of the world. You replicate
Into our fragile romance: a city so enfolded upon itself
It resembles a womb. We are otherwise
Unable to bear the world between us.
We don’t know what else to do
With our desire, which, even emptied out
Into each other, has not been satisfied.
All surfaces beam back a duplicate, an exact
Reproduction replicated with no horizon.
I like you because we are similar enough that
There’s almost nothing I have to change.
In the perfect silent dark 
In the absence of any real others
The rare spots of light seem 
To constellate a destiny we were meant for
All along. The songs of our childhoods
Must have pictured this, water engulfing
The city, and us, daubed by light dappling down
From the surface, fooled by transparency,
Kissing before an altar of the same dreams.

—--


This message is for when 
Threshold crossed
Global warming finally cooks away
The water that has swallowed us, leaving
Only the deepest, most enduring of swimmers
Led by an old Olympian
Now trapped in his sport for life.

After much genetic research
We finally made the first human being
With gills, in a few centuries
We hope to develop tails.

When the water ebbs and dries again
When again we must crawl onto land on all fours
And invent a life on two feet
We will do it. 

You, who have walked into this library, thank you
For climbing to retrieve this volume.
Having inherited our survival, tell us
How you intend to live.
