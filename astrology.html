                  I am a novice astrologer building my fundamental knowledge of the field and developing my astrological ethos. My practice is informed by the teachings and writings of Chris Brennan, Austin Coppock, Melanie Reinhart, and Alice Sparkly Kat.                
                </p>
                <!--<p>
                    My approach is fundamentally aligned with my broader ethos of compassion, presence, and openness to difference. Avoiding diagnostic or pathological readings, I focus on mediation, strategy, autonomy, and release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's delve into your natal chart together to co-create meaning and sensibilities around the unique gifts, challenges, and opportunities that it suggests.
                </p>-->
                <p>
                  I occasionally offer natal chart readings. Do sign up for my slow newsletter via my <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> to be alerted when that happens.

                <h3>ethos</h3>
                <div class="notes">
                  <p>My astrological ethos borrows from the general ethos of counselling, which focuses on aiding you in your process of understanding and making meaning of your life on your terms. I serve as a mirror and temporary companion on your journey, without deciding for you what it means and what you must do.</p>
                  <p>I believe in considering astrological weather as a set of potential energies (with varying probabilities), but not as diagnostic, directive, or predictive indicators which undercut your agency as a living conscious being. We are not in full control of our lives, and these indicators can signal incoming energies and possibilities we should attend to. But they don't direct our lives. Rather, they offer collaborative energies - challenging, neutral, or smooth-flowing - which interact with our individual and collective patterns to produce life. We are <strong>ecological</strong>.</p>
                  <p>An astrological reading is not coaching or therapy, but a collaborative intervention where I act as your astrological interpreter and facilitator. We think and feel aloud, in conversation, as to what feels resonant/ difficult/ luminous/ important for you as we speak.</p>
                  <p>And yes, you can see it all as myth and fiction — the powerful narrative energies and archetypes which have always profoundly shaped our shared lives and resonated against the deep energetic pathways that flow under the surface of reality. It doesn't have to be real for it to be true.</p>
